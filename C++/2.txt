1) Simple
C++ is a simple language because it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), a rich set of library functions, data types, etc.

2) Abstract Data types
In C++, complex data types called Abstract Data Types (ADT) can be created using classes.

3) Portable
C++ is a portable language and programs made in it can be run on different machines.

4) Mid-level / Intermediate programming language
C++ includes both low-level programming and high-level language so it is known as a mid-level and intermediate programming language. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver, etc.

5) Structured programming language
C++ is a structured programming language. In this we can divide the program into several parts using functions.

6) Rich Library
C++ provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast. Following are the libraries used in C++ programming are:

7) Memory Management
C++ provides very efficient management techniques. The various memory management operators help save the memory and improve the program's efficiency. These operators allocate and deallocate memory at run time. Some common memory management operators available C++ are new, delete etc.

8) Quicker Compilation
C++ programs tend to be compact and run quickly. Hence the compilation and execution time of the C++ language is fast.

9) Pointer
C++ provides the feature of pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array, etc. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers.

10) Recursion
In C++, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function.

11) Extensible
C++ programs can easily be extended as it is very easy to add new features into the existing program.

12) Object-Oriented
In C++, object-oriented concepts like data hiding, encapsulation, and data abstraction can easily be implemented using keyword class, private, public, and protected access specifiers. Object-oriented makes development and maintenance easier.

13) Compiler based
C++ is a compiler-based programming language, which means no C++ program can be executed without compilation. C++ compiler is easily available, and it requires very little space for storage. First, we need to compile our program using a compiler, and then we can execute our program.

14) Reusability
With the use of inheritance of functions programs written in C++ can be reused in any other program of C++. You can save program parts into library files and invoke them in your next programming projects simply by including the library files. New programs can be developed in lesser time as the existing code can be reused. It is also possible to define several functions with same name that perform different task. For Example: abs () is used to calculate the absolute value of integer, float and long integer.

15) National Standards
C++ has national standards such as ANSI.

16) Errors are easily detected
It is easier to maintain a C++ programs as errors can be easily located and rectified. It also provides a feature called exception handling to support error handling in your program.

17) Power and Flexibility
C++ is a powerful and flexible language because of most of the powerful flexible and modern UNIX operating system is written in C++. Many compilers and interpreters for other languages such as FORTRAN, PERL, Python, PASCAL, BASIC, LISP, etc., have been written in C++. C++ programs have been used for solving physics and engineering problems and even for animated special effects for movies.

18) Strongly typed language
The list of arguments of every function call is typed checked during compilation. If there is a type mismatch between actual and formal arguments, implicit conversion is applied if possible. A compile-time occurs if an implicit conversion is not possible or if the number of arguments is incorrect.

19) Redefine Existing Operators
C++ allows the programmer to redefine the meaning of existing operators such as +, -. For Example, The "+" operator can be used for adding two numbers and concatenating two strings.

20) Modelling real-world problems
The programs written in C++ are well suited for real-world modeling problems as close as possible to the user perspective.

21) Clarity
The keywords and library functions used in C++ resemble common English words.
